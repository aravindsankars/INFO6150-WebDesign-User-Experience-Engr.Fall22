        <p><u>Abel Makkonen Tesfaye</u> (born February 16, 1990),
            known professionally as <i>the Weeknd</i>, is a Canadian singer,
            songwriter, and record producer.
            Known for his sonic versatility and dark lyricism,
            his music explores
            escapism, romance, and melancholia,
            and is often inspired by personal experiences.</p><br><br>

    <p>Tesfaye earned critical and commercial success with
        his pop-leaning second album Beauty Behind the Madness
        (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained
        the US Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles
        "Can't Feel My Face" and "The Hills", and won the Grammy
        Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated
        for Album of the Year. His trap-infused third studio album
        Starboy (2016) saw similar commercial success and included
        the US number-one single of the same name and won the Grammy
        Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album.</p><br><br>
